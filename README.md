# 🚗 Fleet Management System (OOP in C++)

## 📌 About This Project
This project is a **Fleet Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++.  
It manages different types of vehicles like **Cars, Trucks, Bikes, and Electric Vehicles**.

The code shows:
- ✅ **Inheritance** (all vehicles come from one parent class)
- ✅ **Polymorphism** (each vehicle behaves in its own way)
- ✅ **Dynamic Memory** (vehicles are created and deleted safely)
- ✅ **Encapsulation** (vehicle details are kept safe inside classes)

## 🛠️ Features
- Add vehicles to the fleet 🚗🚚🏍️🔋  
- Start and stop engines 🔑  
- Refuel or recharge all vehicles ⛽⚡  
- Show details of all vehicles 📋  
- Remove any vehicle from the fleet ❌

## 👶 How It Works (Explained Like a Child)
1. **We have a "blueprint"** called `vehicle` – it tells us what every vehicle must be able to do.  
2. **We make special vehicles** (Car, Truck, Bike, Electric Vehicle) that follow this blueprint.  
3. **A manager (Fleet Management System)** keeps a list of all vehicles.  
4. You can **start them, refuel them, and display them** with one command.  
5. When you remove a vehicle, it **vanishes from memory safely**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Copy the code into a file named `main.cpp`.  
2. Compile it with:  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o fleet
